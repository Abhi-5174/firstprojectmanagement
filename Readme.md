# Description

### Creating Milestone
- I have created a milestone titled Initial Setup for my Project.
### Managing Issues:
- I have created three issues for the Project.
### Using Project Boards:
- I have used the Project boards to manage all the tasks properly and to track the work progress of my project.
### Linking Issues to Milestones:
- I have linked two issues with the milestone that I created above named "Initial Setup for my Project".
### Reflection on Project Management Tools:
-  Github's Project Management features like milestones, issues, project boards, etc are very helpfull to manage and track all the progress of the project easily.
-  It can also very useful for team collaboration so that many people can work together in one project no matters in which country they are in.
-  By using these features its easy to organize our Projects in a good and easy way.
-  I did not face any challenges implementing these tools in my project its very easy to use these features any work with them.
